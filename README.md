# Lufia-2-Autotracker
This is an automatic tracker for Lufia 2, mainly randomizer by abbysonym. It is still WIP and will be upgraded over time. Currently it only works accurately with the "official" vanilla snes9x release due to memory mapping. Broader compatibility is planned. Functionality and layout is subject to change.
