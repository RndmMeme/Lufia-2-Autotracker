❓ FAQ
❓ Why is my antivirus freaking out over the .exe?

  PyInstaller bundles a lot into one file. False positives are common. If you're concerned, compile it yourself using the .spec.

❓ Can I use this for other ROMs or versions?

  Depends — custom configs and address files might work with other builds. Supported emulators: Snes9x.
